algebra.py
1. All functions should check that list1.len ==
    list2.len, or should promote the shorter one
    to the length of the longer one, i.e. complex
    becomes a quaternion, octonion, etc.

testAlgebra.py
1. test basic methods, such as constructor
2. Make tests for embedding one algebra in another, such as complex in quaternion.
