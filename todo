Algebra.py
1. All functions should check that list1.len ==
    list2.len, or should promote the shorter one
    to the length of the longer one, i.e. complex
    becomes a quaternion, octonion, etc.

testAlgebra.py
1. Multiplication for oct
2. Division for oct
3. Can I make the tests recursive as in the algebra.alg function?
4. Make tests for embedding one algebra in another, such as complex in quaternion.
